To learn how this application was built you can read the Article here: [https://www.metered.ca/blog/webrtc-with-python-building-a-video-chat-application/](https://www.metered.ca/blog/webrtc-with-python-building-a-video-chat-application/).

Instead of building the React Front-End yourself you can also use Metered Pre-Built UI to [Embed Video Chat ](https://www.metered.ca/embed-video-chat) in your application or website.

It is powered by [Metered Video SDK](https://www.metered.ca/).
